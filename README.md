# MailMate Copy Message Link Command #

Copies a link to the currently selected MailMate message to the clipboard.

The link is copied in multiple formats:

- Rich text
- HTML
- plain text
- URL

With the exception of plain text (which is just the message:// URL), the other formats use the email subject as the link title.

Keyboard shortcut is `^+C`.

If you want the plain text link to be in Markdown format, use `^â‡§+C` (all other formats remain the same).

To install the bundle, download the repo and drop it in your `~/Library/Application Support/MailMate/Bundles` directory.
